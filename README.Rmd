# rcoinapi

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

R package for coinapi.io's REST API. Requires an API key.

## Installation

<!-- You can install the released version of rcoinapi from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with: -->

<!-- ``` r -->
<!-- install.packages("rcoinapi") -->
<!-- ``` -->

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Ramshreyas/rcoinapi")
```
## Usage

Load

```{r example}
library(rcoinapi)
## basic example code
```

Set your API key (Get your API key at https://www.coinapi.io/pricing?apikey)

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
